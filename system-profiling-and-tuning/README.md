## Basics
Each of this document contains basic section to understand the basic system resources, how and where its being used, known issues and fine tuning options. For a performance analyst and performance engineer understanding these basics are must. It helps to observe the issue faster, collect the required data for observations, understand the data better and connect the behaviour of the system well.

## Analysis methodology
This section contains various performance observation methodologies. You need to choose the sequence of methodologies based on your need. Each section also contains the recommended sequence. All these methodologies are discussed in [Methods of performance Analysis](/Method-PerformanceAnalysis.md).
